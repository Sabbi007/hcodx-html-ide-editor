# HCODX Documentation

HCODX is a **privacy-first online HTML IDE editor** built for developers who want a fast, clean, browser-based workflow to write and test **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with **live preview**.  
It is designed to feel like a lightweight desktop IDE — while running entirely on the web.

**Official Tool:** https://hcodx.com

## 1) What HCODX Is (and what it is not)

### ✅ HCODX is:
- A browser-based **HTML/CSS/JS editor** for instant testing and rapid prototyping
- A **live preview** environment to validate UI and behavior quickly
- A tool designed for learning, debugging, and iteration

### ❌ HCODX is not:
- A cloud IDE that uploads your projects to servers
- A backend runtime for server-side code
- A platform that requires accounts or logins to use basic functionality

---

## 2) How HCODX Works (High-Level Architecture)

HCODX follows a simple principle: **your code should stay yours**.

### Editing Layer
You write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inside the editor.

### Preview Layer
HCODX renders your output in a preview environment so you can:
- verify layout and CSS behavior
- test DOM changes and JavaScript logic
- iterate quickly without complex setup

### Local-Only Data Model
HCODX aims to keep user data **local on the device** (browser storage) to protect privacy and ensure fast access.

> Note: Exact storage behavior can vary by browser capabilities and settings, but the intent is to keep user projects local.

## 3) Core Features

### 3.1 Live Preview
HCODX is built around rapid feedback:
- change HTML → see layout updates
- change CSS → see styling immediately
- change JS → test interactions and behavior

Live preview is essential for:
- UI prototyping
- responsive layout checks
- testing component behavior

### 3.2 Fast Browser-Based Workflow
HCODX is optimized for:
- quick startup
- minimal friction
- a clean interface that supports focus

### 3.3 Privacy-First Design
HCODX is designed so your code:
- is not uploaded to a server as a requirement of basic use
- is not stored in a “cloud project” by default
- stays under your control locally

This matters for:
- client work prototypes
- early-stage product drafts
- learning and experimentation without sharing code

### 3.4 Mobile-First Usability
HCODX is designed to work smoothly on:
- desktop browsers
- mobile devices
- tablets  
making it useful when you want a quick test on the go.

## 4) Best Use Cases (Real-World)

### Frontend Learning
If you are learning HTML/CSS/JS, HCODX helps you:
- test concepts instantly
- see cause/effect in real time
- build small exercises without setup

### UI Prototyping
HCODX is excellent for prototyping:
- landing sections
- responsive layouts
- small UI components

### Debugging & Experimentation
When you want to:
- test a new CSS approach
- validate a JS snippet
- isolate a problem quickly  
HCODX gives you a clean sandbox-like workflow.

### Quick Sharing (Workflow Tip)
A common workflow:
1) build a small prototype in HCODX  
2) validate behavior  
3) copy the final code into your project

## 5) Privacy & Security Model

### 5.1 The core idea
HCODX is built to reduce unnecessary exposure of user code.

### 5.2 What “privacy-first” means here
- no forced account creation to start coding
- no mandatory cloud storage for basic use
- local-first workflow design

### 5.3 Practical recommendations
For maximum safety when testing sensitive code:
- avoid pasting production secrets into any client-side tool
- keep API keys in environment variables in real projects
- treat any browser-based editor as “client-side”

HCODX supports privacy, but good security hygiene is always essential.

## 6) Performance Principles

HCODX aims to be:
- fast to load
- responsive to typing
- stable during preview

Performance matters because:
- slow editors kill productivity
- live preview must remain consistent
- mobile devices require careful optimization

## 8) Common Questions

### Does HCODX require an account?
No. The goal is instant use with minimal friction.

### Does HCODX store my code in the cloud?
HCODX is designed for a local-first workflow. Always treat client-side code responsibly and avoid secrets.

### Who is HCODX for?
- developers
- designers

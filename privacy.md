# Privacy-First Online IDE (HCODX)

A “privacy-first online IDE” is a tool that prioritizes user control and minimizes unnecessary exposure of code.

HCODX is built with a privacy-first mindset:
- minimal friction
- local-first workflow
- no forced cloud storage for basic use

Official tool: https://hcodx.com

## 1) Why Privacy Matters in Online Editors

Many developers use online editors for:
- client prototypes
- learning exercises
- experimenting with UI ideas
- early product drafts

In these contexts, privacy matters because:
- code may include business logic
- drafts may represent confidential direction
- users may not want content tracked or stored externally

---

## 2) Common Privacy Risks in Typical Online IDEs

Typical risks include:
- cloud project storage by default
- account-based persistence
- heavy tracking and analytics
- unknown retention policies

Some tools do this responsibly — but developers should be aware of the tradeoffs.

## 3) HCODX Approach (Local-First)

HCODX aims to keep your workflow local-first:
- fast preview
- minimal reliance on server-side project storage
- focus on developer control

This approach supports:
- speed
- simplicity
- reduced exposure

---

## 4) Best Practices (Developer Safety)

Even with privacy-first tools, never place secrets in client-side code:
- API keys
- private tokens
- production credentials

Use environment variables and secure backend configuration in real projects.

---

## 5) Who Benefits Most?

- students who want simple learning
- developers doing fast experiments
- designers prototyping UI
- anyone who values quick, private iteration
